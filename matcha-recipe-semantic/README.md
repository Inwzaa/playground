A structured recipe page designed to practice HTML list types and document flow.

* **Ordered vs. Unordered Lists:**
    * Using `<ul>` for ingredients (order doesn't matter).
    * Using `<ol>` for instructions (step-by-step order matters).
* **Document Sections:** Using `<section>` tags to logically divide the page content.
* **Image Handling:** Displaying a hero image with a semantic caption.

## 🛠️ Built With
